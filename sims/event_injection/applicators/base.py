BaseApplicator — abstract base class for all event applicators.

Subclass this to add new event types. Each applicator must implement:
  - sample_params(): randomly sample the event's variables
  - on_step(): apply the event effect for one sim step

Optionally override on_start() / on_end() for setup / teardown.
