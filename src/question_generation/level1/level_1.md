# Level 1 Question Templates

Level 1 questions focus on **State Identification**. They evaluate the model's ability to extract and interpret raw sensor data and control signals at specific timestamps or over short intervals.

## Core Topics
The questions are categorized into 6 main topics, each with three variants: **True/False (TF)**, **Multiple Choice (MC)**, and **Open-Ended (Open)**.

### 1. Joint Position Movement
Checks if a specific joint's position has changed between two points in time.
- **TF (`state_joint_moved_tf`)**: "Is joint {axis} at the same position at {t1}ms and {t2}ms?"
- **MC (`state_joint_moved_mc`)**: "What is the status of the position of joint {axis} between {t1}ms and {t2}ms?"
- **Open (`state_joint_moved_open`)**: "What is the absolute difference in position of joint {axis}... in rad?"

### 2. Friction Proxy
Evaluates changes in a friction-related proxy (ratio of $|effort\_current| / |feedback\_speed|$) over a time window.
- **TF (`state_friction_increase_tf`)**: "Has the friction proxy for joint {axis} increased from {t1}ms to {t2}ms?"
- **MC (`state_friction_increase_mc`)**: "How did the friction proxy for joint {axis} change from {t1}ms to {t2}ms?"
- **Open (`state_friction_increase_open`)**: "What is the ratio of the friction proxy at {t2}ms compared to {t1}ms?"

### 3. End-Effector Acceleration
Measures the acceleration of the end-effector using vibration sensor data.
- **TF (`state_acceleration_tf`)**: "Is the end-effector acceleration magnitude at {t_ms}ms greater than {threshold}?"
- **MC (`state_acceleration_mc`)**: "Which axis (X, Y, or Z) has the highest absolute acceleration at {t_ms}ms?"
- **Open (`state_acceleration_open`)**: "What is the acceleration of the end effector at {t_ms}ms? (X_Y_Z vector)"

### 4. External Force Detection
Detects if an external force (magnitude) is present at a given timestamp.
- **TF (`state_external_force_detected_tf`)**: "Is an external force detected at {t_ms}ms?"
- **MC (`state_external_force_detected_mc`)**: "What is the detected state of external forces at {t_ms}ms?"
- **Open (`state_external_force_detected_open`)**: "What is the magnitude of the external force detected at {t_ms}ms in N?"

### 5. Joint Jerk
Calculates the numerical jerk (rate of change of acceleration) for a joint using a central difference approximation.
- **TF (`state_jerk_tf`)**: "Does the jerk of joint {axis} at {t_ms}ms exceed {threshold}?"
- **MC (`state_jerk_mc`)**: "What is the magnitude range (Low/Medium/High) of the jerk?"
- **Open (`state_jerk_open`)**: "What is the jerk of joint {axis} at {t_ms}ms in rad/s^3?"

### 6. Torque Magnitude
Measures the absolute torque around a specific axis (X, Y, or Z) derived from wrench data.
- **TF (`state_torque_magnitude_tf`)**: "Is the torque magnitude about the {axis}-axis at {t_ms}ms greater than {threshold}?"
- **MC (`state_torque_magnitude_mc`)**: "Compare the torque magnitude about the {axis}-axis at {t_ms}ms to a threshold."
- **Open (`state_torque_magnitude_open`)**: "What is the torque magnitude about the {axis}-axis at {t_ms}ms in Nm?"

## Answer Formats
| Type | Format |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TF** | Multiple Choice (Single Select) with "Yes" or "No" options. |
| **MC** | Multiple Choice (Single Select) with 2-3 categorical options. |
| **Open** | Numerical values or Tensors (e.g., `X_Y_Z`). |

## Genericity and Adaptability
Level 1 is designed to be **robot-agnostic** by following these principles:

1. **Physical Foundations**: The templates use universal physical concepts (position, velocity, effort, jerk, torque). These apply to any mechanical system with actuators and sensors.
2. **Standardized Data Schema**: The implementation (`mc_truth.py`) assumes a normalized mapping (e.g., `feedback_pos_{i}`). This allows different robots (UR5, Franka, mobile bases) to use the same logic as long as their raw data is pre-processed into this common format.
3. **Parametric Logic**: All questions use configurable thresholds (`eps`, `thresholds`). This ensures that "significant movement" or "high jerk" can be tuned based on the specific accuracy and dynamics of each robot.
4. **Flexible Indexing**: Using `{axis}` and `{axis_label}` allows the templates to scale to robots with varying numbers of joints.

## Usage
To generate Level 1 questions, run the following command from the project root:

```powershell
python -m src.question_generation.level1.level1 -n 100 --seed 27
```

### Options:
- `-n`: Number of questions to generate (default: 100).
- `--seed`: Random seed for reproducibility (you can use any integer, e.g., 27, 42).
- `--test-mode`: **Fast development mode**. Instead of reading full datasets (which can be huge), it only processes the first 1000 rows of each episode. Ideal for verifying templates without waiting for downloads.
