"""Orchestrator: dispatch a (prediction, ground_truth, answer_format) triple
to the right parser, and escalate to the LLM judge when the deterministic
cascade fails.

Policy:

  free_form              -> always judge (paper §3.2 free-form protocol)
  every other format     -> deterministic parser first; only escalate the
                            `unparseable` cases to the judge.

The judge ESCALATION for deterministic formats is "extract & re-parse": the
judge returns the model's intended answer in the canonical format, and we
re-run the matching parser on that string. This keeps scoring deterministic
end-to-end while only paying for the LLM call when we can't read the answer
ourselves.
