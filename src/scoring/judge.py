"""LLM-as-judge for FactoryBench scoring.

Two distinct modes:

  * `score_free_form(...)` — the paper's §3.2 protocol for `free_form` answers:
    classify the model's answer as Wrong (0.0) / Neutral (0.5) / Correct (1.0)
    against a reference. Always invoked for free-form (no deterministic option).

  * `extract(...)` — escalation path for the deterministic formats. When the
    parser cascade returns `unparseable`, we ask the judge to extract the
    model's INTENDED answer in the canonical format (a letter, a TFTF string,
    a number, etc.). The caller then re-runs the parser on the extracted text
    so that the actual scoring stays deterministic.
