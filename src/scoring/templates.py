"""Template-aware judge prompts for L4 free-form items.

Two templates score under explicit rubrics (rather than the generic
0/0.5/1 free-form protocol from the paper §3.2):

  * **Troubleshooting** (template_id=1):
      1.0  → root cause correctly identified AND remediation steps are
             mostly right (do not need to match the reference exactly).
      0.5  → root cause correctly identified, but remediation wrong/missing.
      0.0  → otherwise.

  * **Optimization** (template_id=2):
      1.0  → problematic parameter identified AND adjustment direction is
             correct (increase / decrease in the right direction).
      0.5  → problematic parameter identified, but direction wrong/missing.
      0.0  → otherwise.

Prompts return a single JSON line ``{"score": float, "reason": str}``. The
caller parses with ``parse_verdict()``.

_TROUBLESHOOTING_PROMPT = """You are scoring a model's troubleshooting answer for a robotics sensor-data benchmark.

Rubric (apply strictly, no other values allowed):
  1.0  — the answer correctly identifies the underlying root cause AND the proposed remediation steps are mostly right. The steps do NOT need to match the reference exactly: minor wording differences, additional sensible checks, or omitted minor steps are all fine, as long as the overall remediation is on the right track and would plausibly resolve the issue.
  0.5  — the answer correctly identifies the underlying root cause but the remediation is wrong, missing, or off-topic (e.g. proposes an unrelated fix, contradicts the reference, or refuses to give steps).
  0.0  — the root cause is wrong or absent (model refused, identified the wrong fault, or stated "no anomaly" when one was present).

The known root cause is provided to you separately. An answer counts as identifying the root cause when it names the same physical phenomenon — equivalent paraphrases are fine, but a different fault category (e.g. saying "payload too heavy" when the root cause is "TCP misconfiguration") is wrong.

  0.5  — the answer identifies the problematic parameter but proposes the wrong direction, no direction, or contradictory directions.
  0.0  — the problematic parameter is not identified, or the model recommends adjusting an unrelated parameter, or refuses to answer.
